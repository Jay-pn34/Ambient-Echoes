# Ambient-Echoes
Ambient Echoes is a modern, responsive web app that lets users play ambient sounds like rain, waves, forest, and more. Each sound is displayed as a circular card with a visually-themed volume ring, allowing individual volume control through intuitive drag gestures. Designed for relaxation, focus, and accessibility.
